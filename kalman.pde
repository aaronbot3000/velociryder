 *
 * 1 dimensional tilt sensor using a dual axis accelerometer
 * and single axis angular rate gyro.  The two sensors are fused
 * via a two state Kalman filter, with one state being the angle
 * and the other state being the gyro bias.
 *
 * Gyro bias is automatically tracked by the filter.  This seems
 * like magic.
 *
 * Please note that there are lots of comments in the functions and
 * in blocks before the functions.  Kalman filtering is an already complex
 * subject, made even more so by extensive hand optimizations to the C code
 * that implements the filter.  I've tried to make an effort of explaining
 * the optimizations, but feel free to send mail to the mailing list,
 * autopilot-devel@lists.sf.net, with questions about this code.
